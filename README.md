# Stack The Letter

📜 Write someone a letter.  
💌 Pack it.  
📬 Send it over to a person you like.  
📩 The sentences tumble out as blocks when unpacking.  
🎮 Stack them well, to be able to read the full letter.

Can the letter be revealed?  
Only those who have successfully stacked the text by then will know the end of it.  
If you lose, you will end up with a cliff hanger.
